# dotfiles

A pretty much desktop environment made with openbox and other minimal(-ish) tools

The install script will automatically install needed packages and set up everything for you on an Arch based system. <br>
You can ignore the hardware specific configs and autologin option, those are specific for me.

# Usage
```
stow -t ~ openbox rofi tint2 dunst ...
``` 
or just
```
stow -t ~ *
```

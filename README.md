# dotfiles

A pretty much desktop environment made with openbox and other minimal(-ish) tools

The install script will automatically install needed packages and set up everything for you on an Arch based system, you just need the yay AUR helper installed. <br>
You can ignore the hardware specific configs and autologin options, those are specific for me.

# Usage
```stow -t ~ openbox rofi tint2 dunst ...``` <br>
or just <br>
```stow -t ~ *```
